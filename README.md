# LUNGS-CANCER-DETECTION-AND-CLASSIFICATION
This project focuses on detecting lung cancer using Inception and Resnet50 models with the Chest CTScan dataset. Lung cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, making early detection critical for successful treatment. Convolutional neural networks, such as Inception and Resnet50, have shown great success in image classification tasks.
